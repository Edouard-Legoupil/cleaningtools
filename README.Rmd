The `{cleaningtools}` package focuses on survey data cleaning process. It allow to have a fully documented and reproducible cleaning process, based on the generation of a standardized `cleaning and deletion log`. With such type of process, Quality Assurance and Auditing can be easily performed. 

This tool support the implementation of IMPACT Initiatives / REACH guidance: [Data Cleaning Guidelines for Structured Data](https://www.reachresourcecentre.info/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMPACT_Data-Cleaning-Guidelines_FINAL_To-share-11.pdf) & [Data Cleaning Minimum Standards Checklist](https://www.reachresourcecentre.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMPACT_Memo_Data-Cleaning-Min-Standards-Checklist_28012020-1.pdf).

The workflow supported by the tool includes:

 1. Get your raw data and your form from your Kobo/ODK/ONA server.
 
 2. Define a __list of logical checks__ based on the specific content of your form. This is basically an excel spreadsheet defining checks describing incompatible responses (`check_id`,	`description`,	`check_to_perform`,	`columns_to_clean`) - such as "_primary_livelihood is rented but expenses less than 500000_" or "_access water and tank emptied_".
 
 3. Pipe a list of __systematic checks__ functions to apply on the data (_outliers, shortest path, personally identifiable information, duration..._), including the logical checks previously defined - each of the check will produce a specific log.

 4. Assemble and export the __`cleaning log`__ together in a dedicated excel spreadsheet (`create_xlsx_cleaning_log()`) so that the person responsible for the cleaning can manually make the decision on the cleaning action to perform among the following values:

|value|Definition|
|-----|----------|
|`change_response`|Change the response to new.value|
|`blank_response`|Remove and NA the response|
|`remove_survey`|Delete the survey|
|`no_action_value`|No action to take|

 5. Apply the manually review `cleaning log` on the raw data to obtain the __cleaned data__, aka `checked_dataset` 
 
 6. Then __review__ how the cleaning was applied through dedicated report `review_cleaning()` , `review_the_others_log`, `review_sf` for the sampling frame

## Installation & Usage

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("pak")  
pak::pkg_install("edouard-legoupil/cleaningtools")
```

The package comes with a parameterised report template to ease and speed-up the full process.

Once users have a good understanding of the process above, create an Rstudio projects, install the package, download your data and your form within a dedicated sub-folder for instance `data-raw`, create an excel file to add your `logical checks`, add if any the file defining your `sampling plan`.

Then create a notebook using the `clean` notebook template included in the package and start documenting all the parameters. 

Once done you can run each of the code chunk one after the other. After the first chapter, you should have a `cleaning log` file created within your the same `data-raw` folder. Open it and manually set up the cleaning actions for each of the checks.

Run then the last few chunks to apply the log and review the results... 

Et Voila, you should have then the `cleaned_data` in your  `data-raw` folder

## Current Limitation

The package assumes that the survey data is a single frame, it does not work out of the box with datalist, aka survey dataset that have more than one dataframe
